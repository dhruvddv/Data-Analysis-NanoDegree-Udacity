# Data-Analysis-NanoDegree-Udacity
This is a project work I did for the Udacity Data Analyst Nano degree.

# Project I : Exploring Weather Trends
In this project, we analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

# Project II : Investigate a Dataset  TmDb Movies
In this project, We analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected fromThe Movie Database (TMDb),including user ratings and revenue.
* Certain columns, like ‘cast’and ‘genres’, contain multiplevalues separated by pipe (|)characters.
* There are some odd charactersin the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worryabout cleaning them. You can leave them as is.
* The final two columns endingwith “_adj” show the budget andrevenue of the associated moviein terms of 2010 dollars,accounting for inflation overtime.

# Project III : Analyze A/B Test Results
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these.

For this project, We will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
* Understanding the Dataset
* Messy Data
* Updated DataFrame
* Probability
* Hypothesis Testing

# Project IV : Wrangle and Analyze Data
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. You will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.

The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. More on this soon.
In this project mainly focuses on Data Gathering, Assessing and Cleaning.
Data wrangling, which consists of:
        * Gathering data (downloadable file in the Resources tab in the left most panel of your classroom and linked in step 1 below).
        * Assessing data
        * Cleaning data
Storing, analyzing, and visualizing your wrangled data
Reporting on 
1) your data wrangling efforts and 
2) your data analyses and visualizations

# Project V : Communicate Data Findings Ford GoBike System
This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, you will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, you will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. The primary method of conveying your findings will be through transforming your exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.
