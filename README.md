# Data-Analysis-NanoDegree-Udacity
This is a project work I did for the Udacity Data Analyst Nano degree.

# Project I : Exploring Weather Trends
In this project, we analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

# Project II : Investigate a Dataset  TmDb Movies
In this project, We analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected fromThe Movie Database (TMDb),including user ratings and revenue.
● Certain columns, like ‘cast’and ‘genres’, contain multiplevalues separated by pipe (|)characters.
● There are some odd charactersin the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worryabout cleaning them. You can leave them as is.
● The final two columns endingwith “_adj” show the budget andrevenue of the associated moviein terms of 2010 dollars,accounting for inflation overtime.
