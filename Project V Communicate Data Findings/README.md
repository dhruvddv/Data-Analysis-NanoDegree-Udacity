## Project V Communicate Data Findings Ford GO Bike System

#### Project Details
Dataset: Ford GoBike System
Explore the data: Feel free to explore the jupyter notebook where the dataset is visually, and programatically explored.
Document the story: organized findings convey a story to present to an audience.
Communicate the findings - a slide deck with my findings is prepared for a curious audience.

### Introduction
This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. Note that this dataset will require some data wrangling in order to make it tidy for analysis. There are multiple cities covered by the linked system, and multiple data files will need to be joined together if a full year’s coverage is desired.

#### Step 1: Explore Your Data

It’s time to get to the interesting bits. Explore your data and document your findings in a report. The report should briefly introduce the dataset, then systematically walk through the points of exploration that you conducted. You should have headers and text that organize your thoughts and findings. Visualizations in this part of the project need not be completely polished: this is just your own exploration at this point. However, you should still make sure that you adhere to principles of using appropriate plot types and encodings so that accurate conclusions can be drawn, and that you have enough comments and labeling so that when you return to your work, you can quickly grasp your analysis steps.

If you use a Jupyter Notebook for this step of the project, don’t forget to export the notebook as an html file for the project submission.

#### Step 2: Document your Story

At the end of your exploration, you probably have a bunch of things that you’ve discovered. Now it’s time to organize your findings and select a story that you will convey to others. In your readme document, you should summarize your main findings and reflect on the steps you took in your data exploration. You should also lay out the key insights that you want to convey in your explanatory report as well as any changes to visualizations, or note new visualizations that will be created to bridge between your insights.

#### Step 3: Create your Slide Deck

Follow the plans you laid out in the previous step and create a slide deck with explanatory data visualizations to tell a story about the data you explored. You can start with code that you used in your exploration, but you should make sure that the code is revised so that your plots are polished. Make sure that you also pay attention to aspects of design integrity in your revisions.
